Voting Phase:\nBefore voting, players discuss and exchange ideas based on the information they gathered during the night. \nThe voting is open, and each player cast their vote and pass the device to next player.\nThe player who receives more than half of the votes is eliminated.\nAfter voting is complete, the game transitions back to the night phase, and this cycle continues.\n\nTeams and Objectives\n\nFolk:\nTheir goal is to ensure that, by the end of the game, all surviving players belong only to the Folk team.\n\nCorrupt:\nTheir goal is to ensure that, by the end of the game, all surviving players belong only to the Corrupt team.\n\nNeutral:\nNeutral players have unique win conditions or tasks specific to their roles.
